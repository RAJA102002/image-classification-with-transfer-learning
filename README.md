# Image Classification with Transfer Learning

## Overview
This project implements an image classification system using transfer learning with pre-trained models (e.g., ResNet, VGG16) on a custom dataset.

## Requirements
- Python 3.x
- TensorFlow / Keras
- NumPy
- OpenCV
- Matplotlib
- Pandas

## How to Use
1. Clone this repository.
2. Install dependencies by running `pip install -r requirements.txt`.
3. Run the `train.py` script to start training the model.
4. The model is saved as `model.h5` after training.
